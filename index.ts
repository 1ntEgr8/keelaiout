    What needs to get done?

    What exactly does this app do?
    so what i'm thinking right now is that you will get a sentence to type
    but you will have to type it in and figure out what kind of keyboard layout it is

    based on that you will get points on how fast you type it out

    the score will be based on how fast you type it, and how accurate your typing is

    LETS GOOOOOO

    First thing is to store the mapping between the characters in different layouts

    How should I store the mapping?
    I think the only way to store the mapping is to store it is a map, or an object
    an object will be much easier to work with, but for my purposes, i won't be editing the keystrokes
    so it will be fine to use a map
